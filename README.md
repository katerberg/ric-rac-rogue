# Ric-Rac-Rogue

 Ric-Rac-Rogue is a take on the classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a line of three of your symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In this game, nearly all of the rules will change as you proceed through the levels. You may not be the starting player, you may need more or fewer than 3 in a row to win. The board itself may become blocked to your plays.

You will need to use your array of abilities to allow you to defeat your opponent, which will grant you additional power-ups and the energy that is sorely needed to use them.
